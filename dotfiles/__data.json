Usually these custom configurations are stored in files that start with a dot (hence dotfiles!), and typically located in your users home `~`, or better yet `~/.config` (even this can be customized, for apps that respect the XDG Base Directory spec). Some examples of dotfiles that you're likely already familiar with include `.gitconfig`, `.zshrc` or `.vimrc`.\n\nYou will often find yourself tweaking your configs over time, so that your system perfectly matches your needs. It makes sense to back these files up, so that you don't need to set everything up from scratch each time you enter a new environment. Git is a near-perfect system for this, as it allows for easy roll-backs, branches and it's well supported with plenty of hosting options (like here on GitHub).\n\nOnce everything's setup, you'll be able to SSH into a fresh system or reinstall your OS, then just run your script and go from zero to feeling at right at home within a minute or two.\n\nIt's not hard to create your own dotfile repo, it's great fun and you'll learn a ton along the way!\n\n---\n\n### Why you need a Dotfile System?\n\nBy using a dotfile system, you can set up a brand new machine in minutes, keep settings synced across multiple environments, easily roll-back changes, and never risk loosing your precious config files. \n\nThis is important, because as a developer, we usually have multiple machines (work / personal laptops, cloud servers, virtual machines, some GH codespaces, maybe a few Pis, etc). And you're much more productive when working from a familiar environment, with all your settings applied just how you like them. But it would be a pain to have to set each of these machines up manually. Even if you've only got a single device, how much time would you loose if your data became lost or corrupted?\n\n---\n\n### XDG Directories\n\nThe location of config files can usually be defined using the [XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec), which is honored by most apps. This lets you specify where config, log, cache and data files are stored, keeping your top-level home directory free from clutter. You can do this by setting environmental variables, usually within the [`.zshenv`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/zsh.zshenv) file.\n\nFor example, in my setup I've [set these variables](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/e839ab2d77f0be0d09b4f4ba3503c8b69ad925f3/config/zsh/.zshenv#L6=L10) to:\n\nVariable | Location\n--- | ---\n`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config`\n`XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `~/.local/share`\n`XDG_BIN_HOME`   | `~/.local/bin`\n`XDG_LIB_HOME`    | `~/.local/lib`\n`XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | `~/.local/var/cache`\n\n---\n\n### Containerized Userspace\n\nYou can also containerize your dotfiles, meaning with a single command, you can spin up a fresh virtual environment on any system, and immediately feel right at home with all your configurations, packages, aliases and utils.\n\nThis is awesome for a number of reasons: 1) Super minimal dependency installation on the host 2) Blazing fast, as you can pull your built image from a registry, instead of compiling everything locally 3) Cross-platform compatibility, whatever your host OS is, you can always have a familiar Linux system in the container 4) Security, you can control which host resources are accessible within each container\n\nThere's several methods of doing this, like having a Docker container or spinning up VMs with a predefined config (with something like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or a [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)-based config).\n\nI went with an Alpine-based Docker container defined in the [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/Dockerfile). To try it out, just run `docker run lissy93/dotfiles`.\n\n---\n\n### Security\n\nSomething that is important to keep in mind, is security. Often you may have some personal info included in some of your dotfiles. Before storing anything on the internet, double check there's no sensitive info (think SSH keys, API keys or plaintext passwords). There's several solutions for managing sensitve info.\n\nThe simplest is just to have a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), so no private files get committed. Be sure to make sure your setup doesn't depend on those files though, or you'll get an error while setting up a fresh system.\n\nAnother option, is to encrypt sensitive info. A great tool for this is [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) as it makes GPG-encrypting passwords very easy ([this article](https://www.outcoldman.com/en/archive/2015/09/17/keep-sensitive-data-encrypted-in-dotfiles/) outlines how), or you could also just use plain old GPG (as outlined in [this article](https://www.abdullah.today/encrypted-dotfiles/)).\n\nI went with [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt), a GPG-based solution designed specifically for git repos. There's fallback (safe) plaintext versions, to prevent any errors if the GPG keys aren't present.\n\n---\n\n\n### Dotfile Management Systems\n\nIn terms of managing and applying your dotfiles, you can make things simple, or complex as you like.\n\nThe two most common approaches are be either [symlinking](#option-1---symlinking), or using [git bare repo](#option-2---git-bare-repo), but you could also do things manually by writing a simple script.\n\n#### Option 1 - Symlinking\n\nSymlinks let you maintain all your dotfiles in a working directory, and then link them to the appropriate places on disk, sort of like shortcuts.\n\nFor example, if your dotfiles are in `~/Documents/dotfiles`, you could create a zshrc file there, and link it with:\n\n```bash\nln -s ~/Documents/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc\n``` \n\nThis would obviously get cumbersome very quickly if you had a lot of files, so you would really want to automate this process. You could either create your own script to do this, or use a tool specifically designed for this.\n\nI personally use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), as it doesn't have any dependencies - just include it as a sub-module, define a list of links in a simple YAML file, and hit go.\n[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is also a popular choice, and it's usage is explained well in [this article](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/) by Alex Pearce.\nThere's many other tools which do a similar thing, like [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick), [Rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) or [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).\n\n#### Option 2 - Git Bare Repo\n\nBare repositories let you add files from anywhere on your system, maintaining the original directory structure, and without the need for symlinks ([learn more](https://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/)). Just initiialize or clone using the [`--bare`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---bare) flag, then add a global alias to manage files with git.\n\n```bash\n# Initialise a new repo, or clone an existing one with the --bare flag\ngit init --bare $HOME/dotfiles\n\n# Next create an alias that sets the directory to your dotfile (add to .zshrc/ .bashrc)\nalias dotfiles='$(where git) --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'\n\n# Hide untracked files\ndotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no\n```\n\nThen, from anywhere in your system you can use your newly created alias to add, commit and push files to your repo using all the normal git commands, as well as pull them down onto another system.\n\n```bash\ndotfiles add ~/.config/my-file\ndotfiles commit -m \"A short message\"\ndotfiles push\n```\n\nBoth [Chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/) and [YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) are dotfile management tools, which wrap bare git repo functionality, adding some additional QoL features.\n\nTo learn more, DistroTube made an excellent [video about bare git repos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM), and Marcel Krčah has written [a post](https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/) outlining the benefits.\n\n#### Dotfile Dependencies\n\nIn terms of managing dependencies, using either [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) or [git subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt) will let you keep dependencies in your project, while also separate from your own code and easily updatable. But again, you could do this yourself with a simple script.\n\n\n---\n\n### So copy paste, right?\n\nZach Holman wrote a great article titled [Dotfiles Are Meant to Be Forked](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/). I personally disagree with this, since your dotfiles are usually highly personalized, so what's right for one developer, likely won't be what someone else is looking for. They're also typically something you build up over time, and although some repos may provide a great starting point, it's really important to know what everything does, and how it works.\n\nBy all means feel free to take what you want from mine. I've taken care to ensure that each file is standalone, and well documented so that certain files can just be dropped into any system. But I cannot stress enough the importance of reading through files to ensure it's actually what you want. \n\nIf you're looking for some more example dotfile repos to get you started, I can highly recommend taking a look at: [@holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), [@nickjj/dotfiles](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles), [@caarlos0/dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles), [@cowboy/dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles), [@drduh/config](https://github.com/drduh/config).\n\nAnd for some more inspiration, check out [webpro/awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles), [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/) and [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).\n\n---\n\n## My Dotfiles\n\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cimg width=\"380\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/rH30RbM/Dotfiles.png\" />\u003C/p>\n\n### Setup\n\n> **Warning**\n> Prior to running the setup script, read through everything and confirm it's what you want.\n\nLet's Go!\n\n```bash\nbash \u003C(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/master/lets-go.sh)\n```\n\nThis will execute the quick setup script (in [`lets-go.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/lets-go.sh)), which just clones the repo (if not yet present), then executes the [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) script. You can re-run this at anytime to update the dotfiles. You can also optionally pass in some variables to change the install location (`DOTFILES_DIR`) and source repo (`DOTFILES_REPO`) to use your fork.\n\nThe install script [does several things](#install-script), it takes care of checking dependencies are met, updating dotfiles and symlinks, configuring CLI (Vim, Tmux, ZSH, etc), and will prompt the user to install listed packages, update the OS and apply any system preferences. The script is idempotent, so it can be run multiple times without changing the result, beyond the initial application.\n\n_Alternatively, you can clone the repo yourself, cd into it, allow execution of [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) then run it to install or update._\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Example\u003C/summary>\n\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive git@github.com:Lissy93/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\nchmod +x ~/.dotfiles/install.sh\n~/.dotfiles/install.sh\n```\n\nYou'll probably want to fork the repo, then clone your fork instead, so update the above commands with the path to your repo, and optionally change the clone location on your disk.\n\nOnce the repo is cloned, you can modify whatever files you like before running the install script. The [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) section provides an overview of where each file is located. Then see the [Configuring](#configuring) section for setting file paths and symlink locations. \n\n\u003C/details>\n\n---\n\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n\u003Cpre>\n~\n└──.\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/config\">config/\u003C/a>               # All configuration files\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/bash\">bash/\u003C/a>               # Bash (shell) config\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/tmux\">tmux/\u003C/a>               # Tmux (multiplexer) config\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/vim\">vim/\u003C/a>                # Vim (text editor) config\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh\">zsh/\u003C/a>                # ZSH (shell) config\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/macos\">macos/\u003C/a>              # Config files for Mac-specific apps\n   │ └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/desktop-apps\">desktop-apps/\u003C/a>       # Config files for GUI apps\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts\">scripts/\u003C/a>              # Bash scripts for automating tasks\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/installs\">installs/\u003C/a>           # Scripts for software installation\n   │ │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/installs/Brewfile\">Brewfile\u003C/a>          # Package installs for MacOS via Homebrew\n   │ │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/installs/arch-pacman.sh\">arch-pacman.sh\u003C/a>    # Package installs for Arch via Pacman\n   │ │ └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/installs/flatpak.sh\">flatpak.sh\u003C/a>        # Package installs for Linux desktops via Flatpak\n   │ ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/linux\">linux/\u003C/a>              # Automated configuration for Linux\n   │ │ └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/linux/dconf-prefs.sh\">dconf-prefs.sh\u003C/a>    # Setting GNOME settings via dconf util\n   │ └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/macos-setup\">macos-setup/\u003C/a>        # Scripts for setting up Mac OS machines\n   │   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-apps.sh\">macos-apps.sh\u003C/a>     # Sets app preferences\n   │   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-preferences.sh\">macos-prefs.sh\u003C/a>    # Sets MacOS system preferences\n   │   └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-security.sh\">macos-security.sh\u003C/a> # Applies MacOS security and privacy settings\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/utils\">utils/\u003C/a>                # Handy Shell utilitis for various day-to-day tasks\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/.github\">.github/\u003C/a>              # Meta files for GitHub repo\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/lib\">lib/\u003C/a>                  # External dependencies, as git sub-modules\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/lets-go.sh\">lets-go.sh\u003C/a>            # One-line remote installation entry point\n   ├── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh\">install.sh\u003C/a>            # All-in-one install and setup script\n   └── \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/symlinks.yaml\">symlinks.yml\u003C/a>          # List of symlink locations\n\u003C/pre>\n\n\n---\n\n### Install Script\n\nThe setup script ([`install.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh)) will do the following:\n\n- **Setup**\n  - Print welcome message, and a summary of proposed changes, and prompt user to continue\n  - Ensure that core dependencies are met (git, zsh, vim)\n  - Set variables by reading any passed parameters, or fallback to sensible defaults (see [`.zshenv`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/zsh/.zshenv))  \n- **Dotfiles**\n  - If dotfiles not yet present, will clone from git, otherwise pulls latest changes\n  - Setup / update symlinks each file to it's correct location on disk\n- **System Config**\n  - Checks default shell, if not yet set, will prompt to set to zsh\n  - Installs Vim plugins via Plug\n  - Installs Tmux plugins via TPM\n  - Installs ZSH plugins via Antigen\n  - Prompts to apply system preferences (for compatible OS / DE)\n  - On MacOS arranges apps into folders within the Launchpad view\n  - On MacOS prompts to set essential privacy + security settings\n  - On MacOS prompts to set system preferences and app settings\n- **App Installations**\n  - On MacOS if Homebrew is not yet installed, will prompt to install it\n  - On MacOS will prompt to install user apps listed in Brewfile, via Homebrew\n  - On Linux will prompt to install listed CLI apps via native package manager (pacman or apt)\n  - On Linux desktop systems, will prompt to istall desktop apps via Flatpak\n  - Checks OS is up-to-date, prompts to install updates if available\n- **Finishing up**\n  - Outputs time taken and a summary of changes applied\n  - Re-sources ZSH and refreshes current session\n  - Prints a pretty Tux ASCII picture\n  - Exits\n\nThe install script can accept several flags and environmental variables to configure installation:\n- **Flags**\n  - `--help` - Prints help menu / shows info, without making any changes\n  - `--auto-yes` - Doesn't prompt for any user input, always assumes Yes (use with care!)\n  - `--no-clear` - Doesn't clear the screen before starting (useful if being run by another app)\n- **Env Vars**\n  - `REPO_NAME` - The repository name to pull, e.g. `Lissy93/Dotfiles`\n  - `DOTFILES_DIR` - The directory to clone source dotfiles into, e.g. `~/.dotfiles`\n\n---\n\n### Configuring\n\nThe locations for all symlinks are defined in [`symlinks.yaml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/symlinks.yaml). These are managed using [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), and will be applied whenever you run the [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) script. The symlinks set locations based on XDG paths, all of which are defined in [`.zshenv`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/zsh/.zshenv).\n\n---\n\n## Color Theme\n\n---\n\n### Aliases\n\n#### Into to Aliases\n\nAn alias is simply a command shortcut. These are very useful for shortening long or frequently used commands.\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>How to use Aliases\u003C/summary>\n\nFor example, if you often find yourself typing `git add .` you could add an alias like `alias gaa='git add .'`, then just type `gaa`. You can also override existing commands, for example to always show hidden files with `ls` you could set `alias ls='ls -a'`.\n\nAliases should almost always be created at the user-level, and then sourced from your shell config file (usually `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). System-wide aliases would be sourced from `/etc/profile`. Don't forget that for your changes to take effect, you'll need to restart your shell, or re-source the file containing your aliases, e.g. `source ~/.zshrc`.\n\nYou can view a list of defined aliases by running `alias`, or search for a specific alias with `alias | grep 'search-term'`.

This is useful for setting up a completely fresh system in just a few seconds.\n\n#### MacOS\n\nMacOS includes a built-in utility named [`defaults`](https://real-world-systems.com/docs/defaults.1.html), which lets you configure all system and app preferences programatically through the command line. This is very powerful, as you can write a script that configures every aspect of your system enabling you to setup a brand new machine in seconds.\n\nAll settings are then updated in the `.plist` files stored in `~/Library/Preferences`. This can also be used to configure preferences for any installed app on your system, where the application is specified by its domain identifier - you can view a full list of your configurable apps by running `defaults domains`.\n\n\nIn my dotfiles, the MacOS preferences will configure everything from system security to launchpad layout.\nThe Mac settings are located in [`scripts/macos-setup/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/macos-setup), and are split into three files:\n- [`macos-security.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-security.sh) - Sets essential security settings, disables telementry, disconnects unused ports, enforces signing, sets logout timeouts, and much more\n- [`macos-preferences.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-preferences.sh) - Configures all user preferences, including computer name, highlight color, finder options, spotlight settings, hardware preferences and more\n- [`macos-apps.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup/macos-apps.sh) - Applies preferences to any installed desktop apps, such as Terminal, Time Machine, Photos, Spotify, and many others\n\nUpon running each script, a summary of what will be changed will be shown, and you'll be prompted as to weather you'd like to continue. Each script also handles permissions, compatibility checking, and graceful fallbacks. Backup of original settings will be made, and a summary of all changes made will be logged as output when the script is complete.\n\nIf you choose to run any of these scripts, take care to read it through first, to ensure you understand what changes will be made, and optionally update or remove anything as you see fit.\n\n---\n\n### Config Files\n\nAll config files are located in [`./config/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/config/).\n\nConfigurations for ZSH, Tmux, Vim, and a few others are in dedicated sub-directories (covered in the section below). While all other, small config files are located in the [`./config/general`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/config/general) direcroty, and include:\n\n- [`.bashrc`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.bashrc)\n- [`.curlrc`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.curlrc)\n- [`.gemrc`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.gemrc)\n- [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.gitconfig)\n- [`.gitignore_global`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.gitignore_global)\n- [`.wgetrc`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/.wgetrc)\n- [`dnscrypt-proxy.toml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/dnscrypt-proxy.toml)\n- [`gpg.conf`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/gpg.conf)\n- [`starship.toml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/general/starship.toml)\n\n---\n\n### ZSH\n\n[ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) (or Z shell) is a UNIX command interpriter (shell), similar to and compatible with Korn shell (KSH). Compared to Bash, it includes many useful features and enchanements, notably in the CLI editor, advanced behaviour customization options, filename globbing, recursive path expansion, completion, and it's easyily extandable through plugins. For more info about ZSH, see the [Introduction to ZSH Docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/FAQ/zshfaq01.html).\n\nMy ZSH config is located in [`config/zsh/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/config/zsh)\n\n---\n\n### Vim\n\nThe entry point for the Vim config is the [`vimrc`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/vim/vimrc), but the main editor settings are defined in [`vim/editor.vim`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/vim/editor.vim)\n\n#### Vim Plugins\n\nVim plugins are managed using [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) defined in [`vim/plugins.vim`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/config/vim/setup-vim-plug.vim).\nTo install them from GitHub, run `:PlugInstall` (see [options](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#commands)) from within Vim. They will also be installed or updated when you run the main dotfiles setup script ([`install.sh`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/d4b8426629e7fbbd6d17d0b87f0bb863d6618bfd/install.sh#L132-L134)).\n\nThe following plugins are being used:\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Layout & Navigation\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n- **[Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)**: `vim-airline/vim-airline` -
