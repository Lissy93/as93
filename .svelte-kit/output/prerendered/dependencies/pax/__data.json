Video footage containing fast flickering images, such as camera flashes is non-accessible for some people with photosensitive epilepsy. It also generally decreases the viewing quality of clips.\n\n_This project is a proof of concept, and as such it is yet optimised for production.\u003Cbr>_\n_It was built at [StartHack 19](https://starthack.ch/) by myself and [Ollie](https://github.com/OlliePoole), and won first place :)_\n\n## Example\n\n| Before        | After         |\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\n| ![Demo before running script](docs/before.gif) | ![Demo after running script](docs/after.gif) |\n| ![Chart showing luminosity against frame, before](docs/before-chart-grey.png) | ![Chart showing luminosity against frame, after](docs/after-chart-grey.png) |\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nOnce you've cloned and cd'd into the repo, use Python 3 to run the Pax script, for example:\n\n    python3 main.py -i path/to/your/video.mp4 -o path/to/your/dest.mp4 -c mp4v\n\nWhere the `--ifile` is your input, `--ofile` is your output, and `--codec` is your chosen, and installed codec\n\n## How It Works\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/777919376\">\n  \u003Cp align=\"center\">\n    \u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/HCycD07/alicia-ollie-pax-video-thumbnail.png\" />\n    \u003Cbr>\n    \u003Ci>Watch Interview\u003C/i>\n  \u003C/p>\n\u003C/a>\n\nThe general flow of the program:\n\n![Flow Chart](docs/flow-chart.png)\n\n\n\u003C!-- License + Copyright -->\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\n  \u003Ci>Developed at \u003Ca href=\"https://starthack.ch/\">StartHack 19\u003C/a>, won 1st place 🏆\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ci>© \u003Ca href=\"https://aliciasykes.com\">Alicia Sykes\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/OlliePoole\">Ollie Poole\u003C/a> 2019\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ci>Licensed under \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/143d2ee01ccc5c052a17\">MIT\u003C/a>\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/lissy93\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4KtpYxb/octocat-clean-mini.png\" />\u003C/a>\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003C!-- Dinosaur -->\n\u003C!-- \n                        . - ~ ~ ~ - .\n      ..     _      .-~               ~-.\n     //|     \\ `..~                      `.\n    || |      }  }              /       \\  \\\n(\\   \\\\ \\~^..'                 |         }  \\\n \\`.-~  o      /       }       |        /    \\\n (__          |       /        |       /      `.\n  `- - ~ ~ -._|      /_ - ~ ~ ^|      /- _      `.\n              |     /          |     /     ~-.     ~- _\n              |_____|          |_____|         ~ - . _ _~_-_\n-->\n\n",{"name":3}],"uses":{"params":["repo"]}}]}
