Unlike other shogi variants, it has only one type of piece and is won by capturing all but one of the opponent's pieces.\n\nIf you're interested in building something similar, I recommend taking a look a Ollie's version instead, **[OlliePoole/Hasami-Shogi](https://github.com/OlliePoole/Hasami-Shogi)**\n\n Thanks for taking a look, and you've any questions or suggestions, raise an issue and I'll (dust out my Apple Mac), and look into it :)\n\n> **Note** This was written while Swift was in version 1, and as such there are likely some much more recent board game code examples.\n\n### Features\n\nFully-functional game play, with high-scores, multi-player (based on phone contacts), game play instructions and settings to customize the board and difficulty.\n\n### Building\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:Lissy93/hasami-shogi.git\ncd hasami-shogi\npod install\nopen hasami-shogi.xcworkspace\n```\n\n\u003C!-- License + Copyright -->\n\u003Cp  align=\"center\">\n  \u003Ci>© \u003Ca href=\"https://aliciasykes.com\">Alicia Sykes\u003C/a> 2015\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ci>Licensed under \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/143d2ee01ccc5c052a17\">MIT\u003C/a>\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/lissy93\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4KtpYxb/octocat-clean-mini.png\" />\u003C/a>\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003C!-- Dinosaur -->\n\u003C!-- \n                        . - ~ ~ ~ - .\n      ..     _      .-~               ~-.\n     //|     \\ `..~                      `.\n    || |      }  }              /       \\  \\\n(\\   \\\\ \\~^..'                 |         }  \\\n \\`.-~  o      /       }       |        /    \\\n (__          |       /        |       /      `.\n  `- - ~ ~ -._|      /_ - ~ ~ ^|      /- _      `.\n              |     /          |     /     ~-.     ~- _\n              |_____|          |_____|         ~ - . _ _~_-_\n-->\n",{"name":3}],"uses":{"params":["repo"]}}]}
