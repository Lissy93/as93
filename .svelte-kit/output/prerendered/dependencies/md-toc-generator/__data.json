Just paste in the contents of your markdown document, and results will be coppied to your clipboard.\n\nWhy? Currently Dev.to doesn't automatically generate a table of contents for blog posts. For longer articles, this makes it hard for users to quickly find a specific section. It should work with any markdown content, like GitHub readmes, blog posts, documentation, etc.\n\n## Deployment\nIt's just a static HTML page, so serve it with any web server, CDN or static host.\u003Cbr>\nThere's a demo hosted on GH Pages, at: [lissy93.github.io/md-toc-generator](https://lissy93.github.io/md-toc-generator/)\n\n## Report an Issue\nFound something that's not working?
