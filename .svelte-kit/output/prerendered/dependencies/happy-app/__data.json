Clone the repo, and `cd` into it\r\n 2. `yarn install` the npm node dependencies, and frontend dependencies\r\n 3. Connect to mongo, `mongod`. See the [Getting Started page on MongoDB documentation][2].\r\n 4. Populate the database with some sample data (optional). `gulp populate-sample-data` (*See [Data](#data) section for more info*)\r\n 5. Start the development server, `npm run dev`. This watches, compiles and refreshes appropriate server and client components.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Production Setup\r\n 1. Clone or upload the files to your server directory\r\n 2. Run `yarn`, to install the npm and frontend modules\r\n 3. Create a `.env` file in the project root, and populate it like the example below\r\n 4. Setup and start a mongo instance, and configure the port appropriately in the .env\r\n 5. Build the produciton version, with `npm run buil:prod`\r\n 6. Run `npm run test` to verify that everything is working as expected\r\n 7. Start the app (using a `forever` or `pm2` to keep it alive), `forever start node server`\r\n 8. Set up a cron job or similar to start the app on server reboot    \r\n\r\nExample `.env` file. Will need populating with valid API keys.\r\n```\r\nNODE_ENV=production\r\nPORT=3001\r\nROLLBAR_KEY=123abc\r\nNEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=happy-app\r\nNEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=123abc\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### API Docs\r\n\r\nThe frontend accesses it's data through the set of functions exposed by the backend.\r\nThere are **GET** routes for just returning data, and **POST** routes which update/\r\nadd new data, and require authentication.\r\n\r\nAll API calls are made from `BASE_URL/api/`, where `BASE_URL` is the URI of the app\r\nroot *(e.g. 'localhost', IP address or the domain pointing to main app)*\r\n\r\n#### /teams\r\nReturns an array of all teams referenced to in the datasets\r\n\r\n- **URL:** `/teams/`\r\n- **Method:** `GET`\r\n- **URL Params:** none\r\n- **Success Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `['team-name1', 'team2', 'three', 'forth-team']`\r\n- **Error Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `[]`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### /team-sentiment\r\nReturns all recorded sentiment for all teams\r\n\r\n- **URL:** `/team-sentiment/`\r\n- **Method:** `GET`\r\n- **URL Params:** _none_\r\n- **Success Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `{teamName: '', data: { [.....] }}` (See the above section on [data](#data) format)\r\n- **Error Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `{}`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### /team-sentiment/:team-name\r\nReturns all recorded sentiment data for any given team\r\n\r\n- **URL:** `/team-sentiment/:team-name`\r\n- **Method:** `GET`\r\n- **URL Params:** `teamName` (the name of the team, as a String)\r\n- **Success Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `{teamName: '', data: { [.....] }}` (See the above section on [data](#data) format)\r\n- **Error Response:**\r\n  - **Code:** `200`\r\n  - **Content:** `{}`\r\n  \r\n#### /team-members\r\nReturns all member hashes for each team.

It's also fully responsive so displays nicely across all screen sizes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### D3 Charts Info\r\n\r\nEach [D3.js](http://d3js.org) is in it's own component, so should be able to be\r\nimplemented anywhere in the application, and managed centrally. See\r\n[overview-chart.component.ts](/client/dev/components/overview-chart/overview-chart.component.ts)\r\nfor an example. Team data is managed centrally in  \r\n[team.service.ts](/client/dev/services/team.service.ts) and each chart listens\r\nfor changes in this service and updates accordingly. All the D3 chart components\r\nfollow the same structure. There are (currently) six charts:\r\n\r\n * [`calendar-chart`](/client/dev/components/calendar-chart) - Detailed calendar breakdown for a given team\r\n * [`day-breakdown-chart`](/client/dev/components/day-breakdown-chart) - Breakdown of sentiment results between teams for a given day\r\n * [`grid-chart`](/client/dev/components/grid-chart) - High-level overvier of average sentiment for all teams\r\n * [`message-chart`](/client/dev/components/message-chart) - Visual display of annomised team-member comments for each team\r\n * [`overview-chart`](/client/dev/components/overview-chart) - Donut chart showing proportions of sentiment for a given team\r\n * [`time-chart`](/client/dev/components/time-chart) - Shows sentiment over time, for a given team\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n ### Tech Stack\r\n\r\n The app uses a fairly standard [MEAN] ([Mongo], [Express], [Angular 4], Node) stack, with [D3.js] for the charts,\r\n and isomorphic rendering with [Angular Universal].\r\n\r\n \u003Cdetails>\r\n \u003Csummary>Show Full Tech Stack: \u003C/summary>\r\n \u003Cp>\r\n\r\n\r\n The majority of it was written in/ with [SASS]/[SCSS] (for the styles), [TypeScript] (for client-side JS),\r\n [Babel] (for server-side JS) and [handlebars] (for non-Angular HTML).\r\n\r\n Several utilities proved to be a vital help, when carrying out common tasks, mostly [Bluebird] and [Q] (for promises),\r\n [dotenv] (for managing environmental variables), [RxJS] (mainly for event binding in Angular), and of course [Mongoose]\r\n for making [Mongo] super easy to work with.\r\n\r\n  Testing the app, was made possible using combination of frameworks and libraries. [Cucumber] (for specifying BHD tests),\r\n [Protractor] (for E2E Angular testing), [Karma] (for running the unit tests), [Mocha] (for running server-side tests),\r\n [Chai] (for writing the server side tests), [Istanbul] (for checking test coverage), [Code Climate] (for checking code\r\n quality is on point), [Sinnon.js] (for stubs and spies), [Davis DM] (for checking dependencies are u2d) and [Phantom]\r\n (was initially used for headless browser testing).\r\n\r\n Detailed analytics are collected with [Google Tag Manager (GTM)], and application errors and warnings are tracked with [Rollbar].\r\n \r\n  ![TechStack](/docs/tech-stack.png \"TechStack\")\r\n  \r\n \u003C/p>\r\n \u003C/details>\r\n\r\n [MEAN]: http://mean.io/\r\n [Mongo]: https://www.mongodb.com/\r\n [Express]: https://expressjs.com/\r\n [Angular 4]: https://angular.io/\r\n [D3.js]: https://d3js.org/\r\n [Angular Universal]: https://universal.angular.io/\r\n [SASS]: http://sass-lang.com/\r\n [SCSS]: http://sass-lang.com/\r\n [TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\r\n [Babel]: https://babeljs.io/\r\n [handlebars]: http://handlebarsjs.com/\r\n [Bluebird]: http://bluebirdjs.com\r\n [Q]: https://github.com/kriskowal/q\r\n [dotenv]: https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv\r\n [RxJS]: http://reactivex.io/\r\n [Mongoose]: http://mongoosejs.com/\r\n [Cucumber]: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js\r\n [Protractor]: http://www.protractortest.org/#/\r\n [Karma]: https://karma-runner.github.io\r\n [Mocha]: https://mochajs.org/\r\n [Chai]: http://chaijs.com/\r\n [Istanbul]: https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs\r\n [Code Climate]: https://codeclimate.com/\r\n [Sinnon.js]: http://sinonjs.org/\r\n [Davis DM]: https://david-dm.org/\r\n [Phantom]: http://phantomjs.org/\r\n [Google Tag Manager]: https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/\r\n [Rollbar]: https://rollbar.com/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### File Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nhappy-app\r\n│   README.md\r\n│   package.json    \r\n╰───client\r\n│   ╰───dev\r\n│       │───components\r\n│       │───pages\r\n│       │───services\r\n│       │───styles\r\n│       │───graphics\r\n|       |   app.module.js\r\n|       |   app.ts\r\n|       |   config.js\r\n|       |   index.html\r\n|       |   main-jit.ts\r\n|       |   main-aot.ts\r\n|    ___|   manifest.json\r\n|   |   \r\n│   ╰───dist\r\n│       ╰─── ...     \r\n└───server\r\n|   │───api\r\n|   │───auth\r\n|   │───commons\r\n|   │───config\r\n|   │───constants\r\n|   │───routes\r\n|     │   error-tracking.js\r\n|     │   index.js\r\n|     ╰   server.js\r\n╰───tasks\r\n|\r\n╰───tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Test Environment\r\n\r\n>In order to develop high quality software, thorough testing is essential.\r\n\r\nThis section is a high level presentation of the test approach to be undertaken \r\nin relation to Happy App.\r\n\r\n#### Test Driven Development\r\nThis is a process where the tests are written before the code is developed. \r\nThe test cases are written based on the user stories, and most the logic on \r\nthe application is developed in the tests, so when it comes to writing the \r\ncode it should be a very quick process.\r\n\r\nTDD was chosen as the testing methodology, as it has several key advantages. \r\nFirstly it will ensure the code that is written is structured, as the structure\r\n must be determined before the code can be written. Secondly it helps the code \r\n fit with the user stories, since the tests will be based from the user stories. \r\n It also creates a detailed specification. Most importantly less time is spend \r\n debugging and fixing bugs, as code is written to pass tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Unit Testing\r\nUnit testing involves writing a series of very thorough tests to cover each \r\nmodule, function or method independently as a unit. Each function should be \r\nchecked that it produces the expected output with a variety of hardcoded inputs. \r\nThis should include testing error handling, and borderline and unexpected inputs. \r\nAfter the unit tests have been written the unit test process can be automated, \r\nso every time a method is changed, the tests are rerun to check that it still \r\nproduces the correct output with various inputs.\r\n\r\nUnit testing has a lot of benefits to software development, firstly any \r\npotential bugs or failures will be identified before that function gets \r\nintegrated with the larger application. Developers can verify their code \r\nstill works as expected as they refractor and change parts, in the same \r\nway, unit testing can prevent future changes from breaking functionality. \r\nIt also helps you understand your code, and gives you instant feedback when \r\nsomething is not working as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Behaviour Driven Development\r\nThis is the same principle as TDD, but involves writing tests with a more \r\nfunctional point of view. The syntax used to write the tests tends to be more \r\nlike English, and the tests follow very closely to the user stories. \r\nFollowing BDD will ensure that the code written follows user stories, so as \r\nlong as they are complete, then the finished solution should also be thorough.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Pass/ Fail Criteria\r\n\r\n| Test Type          | Pass Condition                                                                          |\r\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Functional Testing | All acceptance criteria must be met, checked and documented                             |\r\n| Unit Tests         | 100% of unit tests must pass. It will be immediately clear when a unit test is failing  |\r\n| Integration Tests  | 100% pass rate after every commit                                                       |\r\n| Coverage Tests     | 80% or greater                                                                          |\r\n| Code Reviews       | B grade/ Level 4 or higher. Ideally A grade/ Level 5 if possible.                       |\r\n| Dependency Checks  | Mostly up-to-date dependencies except in justified circumstances.                       |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Documenting Results\r\nA ststus of all unit tests, coverage tests, dependency checks and code review \r\nwill be displayed in the form of badges on the repository readme. Each will be \r\nlinked with the appropriate service, so will update live. This will indicate \r\nimmediately as soon as a test is failing or a dependency becomes outdated.\r\n\r\nDetailed test reports for each testing method will also be generated and saved.\r\n\r\n#### Testing Tools\r\n\r\n##### Framework (with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha))\r\nMocha is a feature-rich and well established JavaScript testing framework. \r\nA JavaScript framework is required in order to store, write and run the tests \r\nin a structured way. Using a framework will also make using various testing \r\nplugins easier to use neatly. \r\n\r\n##### Assertion Library (with [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai))\r\nAn assertion library will provide structure and syntax in order to actually \r\nwrite the test cases. Chai is a good choice, as it fits nicely with Mocha, \r\nand has a very flexible syntax, including a �should� library built in, which \r\nwill allow for tests to be written in a BDD style.\r\n\r\n##### Coverage Testing (with [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul))\r\nCoverage testing measures the proportion of your source code that is covered \r\nby your unit tests. It can be very helpful while developing as it makes it \r\neasier to aim for as close to 100% as possible. It also highlights the code \r\nthat is not covered by unit tests. For this project Istanbul will be configured \r\nto show a coverage summary in the console when a test or source code file \r\nchanges, it will also generate a much more detailed HTML report that will be \r\nsaved in the reports directory.\r\n\r\n##### Stubs, Spies and Mocking (with [Sinon.js](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon))\r\nFor the tests, it is not good practice to have any network calls, so Sinon.js \r\nwill be used to stub the data that would have been returned for each network \r\ncall. Spies will also be used to test the functionality of methods.\r\n\r\n##### Continuous Integration Testing (with [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci))\r\nSince the code will be written following a very modular approach, and each \r\nmodule will be thoroughly tested standalone but it is of course vital that \r\nthey work together seamlessly as they are meant to. A Travis CI configuration \r\nfile will be written in a Yamel format, which will specify to Travis which \r\ntests need to be run in order to ensure the code is working as it should, \r\nand which versions of Node (and other technologies) the code will need to be \r\nrun on. Then every time a new commit is made Travis will run tests to ensure \r\neverything continues to pass, and the code repository is not broken by the \r\nlatest commit.\r\n\r\n##### Dependency Checking (with [David](https://github.com/alanshaw/david))\r\nSince there are quite a few external dependencies that come together to make \r\neach component of the project possible, it is important to ensure that all \r\nthe current dependencies are stable and have no bugs that could effect the \r\nrunning of TSV. For this automated dependency checking will be implemented \r\nwith David-DM. When a dependency is no longer in date an notification will \r\nbe triggered.\r\n\r\n##### Automated Code Review's (with [Code Climate](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate))\r\nCode reviews can pick up on bad practices and inefficient code, such as \r\nincluding dependencies and not using them, variables in the wrong scope, \r\npoor identifiers, not following convention etc.. All of this information \r\ncan help write better quality code. Code Climate also provides automated \r\ncoverage testing in conjunction with Istanbul.\r\n\r\n##### Headless Browser Testing (with [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs))\r\nFor running functional frontend tests without having to use a browser, \r\nit can be automated in the same way as the other tests and can test the \r\nintegration with other frontend libraries. PhantomJS also provides network \r\nmonitoring utilities that can help cut down page load times.\r\n\r\n##### Testing HTTP services (with [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest))\r\nSuperTest is an agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using \r\na fluent API. It will be used for testing HTTP servers. It will be used to \r\ncheck the routing for the Express web service, to ensure with a given URL \r\nand parameters returns the expected output.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Project Planning\r\n\r\n\r\n### High-Level Flow Chart\r\n\r\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cimg align=\"center\" width=\"800\" src=\"/docs/high-level-flow-chart.png\" alt=\"Flowchart\" title=\"Flowchart\" />\u003C/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Wireframes\r\n\r\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cimg align=\"center\" width=\"800\" src=\"/docs/wireframes.png\" alt=\"Wireframes\" title=\"Wireframes\" />\u003C/p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### High-Level Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n#### Mail Scheduler\r\n_The system the sends out periodic emails to team members, collects, verifies, formats and inserts results_\r\n- Maintains a list of email addresses for each member of each team\r\n- Generates unique data-collection links ( associated with email address, timestamp and mood)\r\n- Sends emails at a specified time on given days (e.g. 4pm Mon- Fri)\r\n- Verifies that users response is valid (from team-member email, and not already submitted within timeframe)\r\n- Inserts team members response into the database\r\n\r\n#### View Responses (Individual Team)\r\n_A series of data visualisations to display team mood_\r\n- Overview chart. A very simple proportion (donut) chart, showing overall percentages. Should allow the user to switch between displaying results from today, this week, and this month.\r\n- Time chart. A line chart showing team sentiment over-time. Should allow the user to switch between aggregate (one line representing overall sentiment), and breakdown (line for each sentiment).\r\n- Calendar view. A detailed month-view calendar, showing the number of responses for each sentiment per day, with hover tooltip to view comments (if applicable) for each response.\r\n- Comment view. Show's in plain text the comments, sorted by most recent first.\r\n- Sentiment word cloud. Generated from comments, size of word represents number of occurrences, colour represents sentiment.\r\n- Grid view. Grid to show responses over time, the primary use of this is to gauge what percentage of team members consistently respond to the survey.\r\n- Stats view. Numeric value, displaying the worst and best day, highest and lowest participation day.\r\n\r\n#### View Responses (All Teams)\r\n_The homepage will provide entry point to the application, as well as a quick overview of each team_\r\n- List all teams, as links to their team response page\r\n- Show small overview for each team\r\n- Time Grid. The primary data visualisation for the homepage, is a grid, with row for each team, and column for each day, coloured by response.\r\n\r\n#### Admin Dashboard\r\n_Allows team admin to modify certain application settings and maintain the team member list_\r\n- Should be secured, only accessible using admin credentials\r\n- Should allow the admin to modify when emails are sent out (times and days)\r\n- Should allow admin to add and remove team email addresses on the distribution list\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Legal\r\n\r\n### Licensing Summary\r\n\r\nHappy App is licensed under the Fair Source 5 License.\r\nIt is neither open nor closed source, the code can be viewed by anyone, but it can not be used, without \r\nwritten permission for any organisation over 5 users.\r\nSee http://fair.io/ for more information. \r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nFair Source License, version 0.9\r\nCopyright © 2017 Alicia Sykes\r\n\r\n**Licensor**: [Alicia Sykes](http://aliciasykes.com)\r\n\r\n**Software**: Happy App\r\n\r\n**Use Limitation**: 5 users\r\n\r\n**License Grant**.
