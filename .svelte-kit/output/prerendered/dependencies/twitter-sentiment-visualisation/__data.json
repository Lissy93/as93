Unit, integration, coverage and depencency tests can be run using `yarn test`.\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n \u003Csummary>Pass/ Fail Criteria\u003C/summary>\n \n| Test Type          | Pass Condition                                                                          |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Functional Testing | All acceptance criteria must be met, checked and documented                             |\n| Unit Tests         | 100% of unit tests must pass. It will be immediately clear when a unit test is failing  |\n| Integration Tests  | 100% pass rate after every commit                                                       |\n| Coverage Tests     | 80% or greater                                                                          |\n| Code Reviews       | B grade/ Level 4 or higher.

For more info, see the [Build Environment] docs.\n\nThe following tasks are useful for getting started:\n- `gulp generate-config` - Generates correctly structured default configuration files for settings and API keys\n- `gulp build` - Builds the project fully, including optimization, compilation, minification and validation\n- `gulp nodemon` - Runs the application on the default port (probably 8080), with live refresh\n- `gulp test` - Executes all unit and coverage tests, and generates a report containing the results\n- `gulp` - Default dev task - check the project is configured correctly, build ALL the files, run the server, watch for changes, recompile relevant files and reload browsers on change, and keep all browsers in sync, when a test condition changes it will also re-run tests - a lot going on!\n\n---\n\n## Modules\n\nThe project was developed in a modular approach, made up of several distinct components.\nEach is published as a fully tested, documented and MIT-licensed NPM module for easy re-use.\n\n- [sentiment-analysis] - Useses AFINN-111 approach to calculate overall sentiment of a given sentence\n- [fetch-tweets] - Fetches tweets from Twitter based on topic, location, timeframe or combination\n- [stream-tweets] - Streams live Twitter data in real-time, based on location, given term, etc\n- [remove-words] - Removes all non-key words from a given string\n- [place-lookup] - Finds the latitude and longitude for any fuzzy place name using the Google Places API\n- [hp-haven-sentiment-analysis] - A Node.js client library for HP Haven OnDemand Sentiment Analysis module\n- [haven-entity-extraction] - Node.js client for HP Haven OnDemand Entity Extraction\n- [tweet-location] - Calculates the location from geo-tagged Tweets using the Twitter Geo API\n- [find-region-from-location] - Given a latitude and longitude calculates which region that point belongs in\n\n---\n\n## Project Info\n\n#### Project Planning\n\nA set of [User Stories with Acceptance Criteria] and [Complexity Estimates](docs/story-points.md) were drawn up outlining what features the finished solution should have. These were expaned upon further with wireframes in the [Methodology](https://github.com/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation/blob/dev/docs/methodology-frontend.md) section.\n\n#### Technologies\n\nView full tech stack at: [stackshare.io/Lissy93/sentiment-sweep](http://stackshare.io/Lissy93/sentiment-sweep)\n\nThe backend is primarily written in Node.js, with web-sockets facilitating the real-time communication with the frontend, and a data cache stored in MongoDB. Pages are rendered isomorphically, with data visualizations written using D3.js. Social data is fetched from Twitter, compute happens locally, and a few external APIs were used to provide additional context in the form of AI. Views are written in Pug, styles in Less, scripts in CoffeeScript and everything is compiled via a Gulp script.\n\nThe project and app are still functional, however 5 years on, this would not be an ideal tech stack. There are now better technologies available that would enable greater performance, less code, easier project management and improved developer experience. If I was to re-write this project in 2022, a better tech stack would likely be Go for the backend, Svelte + Svelte Kit for the frontend and TypeScript for the code, with Pixi.js for the interactive content, styled-components for styling and Rollup for putting it all together.\n\n#### Status\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation)\n[![View on Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/Lissy93/Twitter-Sentiment-Visualisation)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation)\n![Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/sentiment-analysis)\n[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&down_message=Down&up_color=green&up_message=Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsentiment-sweep.com%2F)](https://sentiment-sweep.com/)\n\n#### Demo\n\nA live demo of the application has been deployed to: [http://sentiment-sweep.com](http://sentiment-sweep.com)\n\nView [Screenshots](/docs/screenshots#readme) of each screen in the docs.\n\n[![Screenshots](https://i.ibb.co/873YkwP/sentiemnt-sweep-screenshots.png)](/docs/screenshots#readme)\n\n#### Awards\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://notes.aliciasykes.com/p/0s5s3uOtKj\">\u003Cimg align=\"left\" width=\"240\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/RzcxQGK/profile1.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Sykes - StartHack Winner\" />\u003C/a>\n\u003Ca href=\"https://oxon.bcs.org/2016/06/27/annual-student-prizes-2016/\">\u003Cimg align=\"left\" width=\"315\" src=\"https://oxon.bcs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0681-768x576.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Sykes - Oxford Winner\" />\u003C/a>\n\nThe first stages of the project were developed at StartHack Switzerland 2014, where it won first-place. \n\nIt was then further expanded upon, and used as part of my undergraduate thesis, where it won the Oxford BCS best Dissertation Award.\n\n\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\n\nThe University Project recieved 96%, so feel free to use it as an example - here's the [Final Report](https://www.docdroid.net/x8srrAf/final-report-with-appendix-asykes-12011471-pdf) in PDF format (warning - it's 300 pages!).
