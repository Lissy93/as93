And because it was just built as a learning exercise, and the app doesn't really have any real-world uses, it isn't actively maintained.\n\n#### Similar Projects\nThe [iOS-Observation-Tracker](https://github.com/OlliePoole/iOS-Observation-Tracker) by [@OlliePoole](https://github.com/OlliePoole) is very similar, and is probably much better written.\n\n---\n\n## Developing\nClone the repo, run `pod install` to fetch dependencies, then open the workspace in xcode. From there you can launch the simulator, build the app, and run the unit tests.\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome :) \nChanges can be submitted by opening a pull request - if you're new to GitHub, see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) for a step-by-step guide on how to submit edits to projects.
