In general, the schemes in this project are suitable for any company.\n\n### Scanning / Pentesting\n\n- [OpenVAS](http://www.openvas.org/) - OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution.\n- [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) - A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.\n- [Kali](https://www.kali.org/) - Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. Kali Linux is preinstalled with numerous penetration-testing programs, including nmap (a port scanner), Wireshark (a packet analyzer), John the Ripper (a password cracker), and Aircrack-ng (a software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs).\n- [tsurugi](https://tsurugi-linux.org/) - heavily customized Linux distribution that designed to support DFIR investigations, malware analysis and OSINT activities. It is based on Ubuntu 20.04(64-bit with a 5.15.12 custom kernel)\n- [pig](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/pig) - A Linux packet crafting tool.\n- [scapy](https://github.com/gpotter2/awesome-scapy) - Scapy: the python-based interactive packet manipulation program & library.\n- [Pompem](https://github.com/rfunix/Pompem) - Pompem is an open source tool, which is designed to automate the search for exploits in major databases. Developed in Python, has a system of advanced search, thus facilitating the work of pentesters and ethical hackers. In its current version, performs searches in databases: Exploit-db, 1337day, Packetstorm Security...\n- [Nmap](https://nmap.org) - Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.\n- [Amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass) - Amass performs DNS subdomain enumeration by scraping the largest number of disparate data sources, recursive brute forcing, crawling of web archives, permuting and altering names, reverse DNS sweeping and other techniques.\n- [Anevicon](https://github.com/rozgo/anevicon) - The most powerful UDP-based load generator, written in Rust.\n- [Finshir](https://github.com/isgasho/finshir) - A coroutines-driven Low & Slow traffic generator, written in Rust.\n- [Legion](https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion) - Open source semi-automated discovery and reconnaissance network penetration testing framework.\n- [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) - Fast subdomains enumeration tool for penetration testers\n- [RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) - Faster Nmap scanning with Rust. Take a 17 minute Nmap scan down to 19 seconds.\n- [Boofuzz](https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz) - Fuzzing engine and fuzz testing framework.\n- [monsoon](https://github.com/RedTeamPentesting/monsoon) - Very flexible and fast interactive HTTP enumeration/fuzzing.\n- [Netz](https://github.com/spectralops/netz)- Discover internet-wide misconfigurations, using zgrab2 and others.\n- [Deepfence ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper) - Apache v2, powerful runtime vulnerability scanner for kubernetes, virtual machines and serverless.\n\n### Monitoring / Logging\n\n- [justniffer](http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/) - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all \"intercepted\" files from the HTTP traffic.\n- [httpry](http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/) - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.\n- [ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.\n- [passivedns](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns) - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffs traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs the DNS-server answers to a log file.
