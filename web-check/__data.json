The IP associated with a given domain can be found by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for the domain's A (address) record.\n\n###### Use Cases\nFinding the IP of a given server is the first step to conducting further investigations, as it allows us to probe the server for additional info. Including creating a detailed map of a target's network infrastructure, pinpointing the physical location of a server, identifying the hosting service, and even discovering other domains that are hosted on the same IP address.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Understanding IP Addresses](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-ip-addresses-subnets-and-cidr-notation-for-networking)\n- [IP Addresses - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)\n- [RFC-791 Internet Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791)\n- [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>SSL Chain\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/kB7LsV1/wc-ssl.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nSSL certificates are digital certificates that authenticate the identity of a website or server, enable secure encrypted communication (HTTPS), and establish trust between clients and servers. A valid SSL certificate is required for a website to be able to use the HTTPS protocol, and encrypt user + site data in transit. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third parties that verify the identity and legitimacy of the certificate holder.\n\n###### Use Cases\nSSL certificates not only provide the assurance that data transmission to and from the website is secure, but they also provide valuable OSINT data. Information from an SSL certificate can include the issuing authority, the domain name, its validity period, and sometimes even organization details. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of a website, understanding its security setup, or even for discovering associated subdomains or other services.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [TLS - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n- [What is SSL (via Cloudflare learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/)\n- [RFC-8446 - TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)\n- [SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>DNS Records\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Q1kMwM/wc-dns.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task involves looking up the DNS records associated with a specific domain. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Various types of DNS records exist, including A (address), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text), among others.\n\n###### Use Cases\nExtracting DNS records can provide a wealth of information in an OSINT investigation. For example, A and AAAA records can disclose IP addresses associated with a domain, potentially revealing the location of servers. MX records can give clues about a domain's email provider. TXT records are often used for various administrative purposes and can sometimes inadvertently leak internal information. Understanding a domain's DNS setup can also be useful in understanding how its online infrastructure is built and managed.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [What are DNS records?

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. They hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, such as site preferences, the state of the user's session, or tracking information.\n\n###### Use Cases\nCookies can disclose information about how the website tracks and interacts with its users. For instance, session cookies can reveal how user sessions are managed, and tracking cookies can hint at what kind of tracking or analytics frameworks are being used. Additionally, examining cookie policies and practices can offer insights into the site's security settings and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Cookie Docs (Mozilla)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n- [What are Cookies (via Cloudflare Learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/)\n- [Testing for Cookie Attributes (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes)\n- [RFC-6265 - Coolies](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Crawl Rules\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KwQCjPf/wc-robots.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nRobots.txt is a file found (usually) at the root of a domain, and is used to implement the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) to indicate which pages should be ignored by which crawlers and bots. It's good practice to avoid search engine crawlers from over-loading your site, but should not be used to keep pages out of search results (use the noindex meta tag or header instead).\n\n###### Use Cases\nIt's often useful to check the robots.txt file during an investigation, as it can sometimes disclose the directories and pages that the site owner doesn't want to be indexed, potentially because they contain sensitive information, or reveal the existence of otherwise hidden or unlinked directories. Additionally, understanding crawl rules may offer insights into a website's SEO strategies.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Google Search Docs - Robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro)\n- [Learn about robots.txt (via Moz.com)](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt)\n- [RFC-9309 -  Robots Exclusion Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9309/)\n- [Robots.txt - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Headers\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/t3xcwP1/wc-headers.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThe Headers task involves extracting and interpreting the HTTP headers sent by the target website during the request-response cycle. HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent at the start of an HTTP response, or before the actual data. Headers contain important directives for how to handle the data being transferred, including cache policies, content types, encoding, server information, security policies, and more.\n\n###### Use Cases\nAnalyzing HTTP headers can provide significant insights in an OSINT investigation. Headers can reveal specific server configurations, chosen technologies, caching directives, and various security settings. This information can help to determine a website's underlying technology stack, server-side security measures, potential vulnerabilities, and general operational practices.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Headers - Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n- [RFC-7231 Section 7 - Headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7)\n- [List of header response fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)\n- [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Quality Metrics\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Kqg8rx7/wc-quality.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nUsing Lighthouse, the Quality Metrics task measures the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the target website.

This is done by looking up the IP in a location database, which maps the IP to a lat + long of known data centers and ISPs. From the latitude and longitude, it's then possible to show additional contextual info, like a pin on the map, along with address, flag, time zone, currency, etc.\n\n###### Use Cases\nKnowing the server location is a good first step in better understanding a website. For site owners this aids in optimizing content delivery, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements, and identifying potential latency issues that may impact user experience in specific geographical regions. And for security researcher, assess the risk posed by specific regions or jurisdictions regarding cyber threats and regulations.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [IP Locator](https://geobytes.com/iplocator/)\n- [Internet Geolocation - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Associated Hosts\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/25j1sT7/wc-hosts.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task involves identifying and listing all domains and subdomains (hostnames) that are associated with the website's primary domain. This process often involves DNS enumeration to discover any linked domains and hostnames, as well as looking at known DNS records.\n\n###### Use Cases\nDuring an investigation, understanding the full scope of a target's web presence is critical. Associated domains could lead to uncovering related projects, backup sites, development/test sites, or services linked to the main site. These can sometimes provide additional information or potential security vulnerabilities. A comprehensive list of associated domains and hostnames can also give an overview of the organization's structure and online footprint.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [DNS Enumeration - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_enumeration)\n- [OWASP - Enumerate Applications on Webserver](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/04-Enumerate_Applications_on_Webserver)\n- [DNS Enumeration - DNS Dumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)\n- [Subdomain Finder](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Redirect Chain\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hVVrmwh/wc-redirects.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task traces the sequence of HTTP redirects that occur from the original URL to the final destination URL. An HTTP redirect is a response with a status code that advises the client to go to another URL. Redirects can occur for several reasons, such as URL normalization (directing to the www version of the site), enforcing HTTPS, URL shorteners, or forwarding users to a new site location.\n\n###### Use Cases\nUnderstanding the redirect chain can be useful for several reasons. From a security perspective, long or complicated redirect chains can be a sign of potential security risks, such as unencrypted redirects in the chain. Additionally, redirects can impact website performance and SEO, as each redirect introduces additional round-trip-time (RTT). For OSINT, understanding the redirect chain can help identify relationships between different domains or reveal the use of certain technologies or hosting providers.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Redirects - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections)\n- [URL Redirection - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection)\n- [301 Redirects explained](https://ahrefs.com/blog/301-redirects/)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>TXT Records\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/wyt21QN/wc-txt-records.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nTXT records are a type of DNS record that provides text information to sources outside your domain. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as verifying domain ownership, ensuring email security, and even preventing unauthorized changes to your website.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThe TXT records often reveal which external services and technologies are being used with a given domain. They may reveal details about the domain's email configuration, the use of specific services like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, or security measures in place such as SPF and DKIM. Understanding these details can give an insight into the technologies used by the organization, their email security practices, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [TXT Records (via Cloudflare Learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/)\n- [TXT Records - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record)\n- [RFC-1464 - TXT Records](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1464)\n- [TXT Record Lookup (via MxToolbox)](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Server Status\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/V9CNLBK/wc-status.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nChecks if a server is online and responding to requests.\n\n###### Use Cases\n\n\n###### Useful Links\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Open Ports\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/F8D1hmf/wc-ports.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nOpen ports on a server are endpoints of communication which are available for establishing connections with clients. Each port corresponds to a specific service or protocol, such as HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), etc. The open ports on a server can be determined using techniques such as port scanning.\n\n###### Use Cases\nKnowing which ports are open on a server can provide information about the services running on that server, useful for understanding the potential vulnerabilities of the system, or for understanding the nature of the services the server is providing.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [List of TCP & UDP Port Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)\n- [NMAP - Port Scanning Basics](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Traceroute\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/M59qgxP/wc-trace-route.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nTraceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet of information from one system to another. It records each hop along the route, providing details about the IPs of routers and the delay at each point.\n\n###### Use Cases\nIn OSINT investigations, traceroute can provide insights about the routing paths and geography of the network infrastructure supporting a website or service. This can help to identify network bottlenecks, potential censorship or manipulation of network traffic, and give an overall sense of the network's structure and efficiency. Additionally, the IP addresses collected during the traceroute may provide additional points of inquiry for further OSINT investigation.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Carbon Footprint\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/5v6fSyw/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-19-07-50.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task calculates the estimated carbon footprint of a website. It's based on the amount of data being transferred and processed, and the energy usage of the servers that host and deliver the website. The larger the website and the more complex its features, the higher its carbon footprint is likely to be.\n\n###### Use Cases\nFrom an OSINT perspective, understanding a website's carbon footprint doesn't directly provide insights into its internal workings or the organization behind it. However, it can still be valuable data in broader analyses, especially in contexts where environmental impact is a consideration.

This is because the DNS system includes no built-in methods to verify that the response to the request was not forged, or that any other part of the process wasn’t interrupted by an attacker. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) secures DNS lookups by signing your DNS records using public keys, so browsers can detect if the response has been tampered with. Another solution to this issue is DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLD).\n\n###### Use Cases\nDNSSEC information provides insight into an organization's level of cybersecurity maturity and potential vulnerabilities, particularly around DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. If no DNS secururity (DNSSEC, DoH, DoT, etc) is implemented, this may provide an entry point for an attacker.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Site Features\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gP4P6kp/wc-features.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nChecks which core features are present on a site.

A website can be included in the HSTS preload list by conforming to a set of requirements and then submitting itself to the list.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThere are several reasons why it's important for a site to be HSTS enabled:\n      1. User bookmarks or manually types http://example.com and is subject to a man-in-the-middle attacker\n        HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain\n      2. Web application that is intended to be purely HTTPS inadvertently contains HTTP links or serves content over HTTP\n        HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain\n      3. A man-in-the-middle attacker attempts to intercept traffic from a victim user using an invalid certificate and hopes the user will accept the bad certificate\n        HSTS does not allow a user to override the invalid certificate message\n        \n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>DNS Server\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/tKpL8F9/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-43-12.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis check determines the DNS server(s) that the requested URL / IP resolves to.

It allows domain owners to specify how to handle unauthenticated mail via a published policy in DNS, and provides a way for receiving mail servers to send feedback about emails' compliance to the sender. BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification): BIMI is an emerging email standard that enables organizations to display a logo in their customers' email clients automatically. BIMI ties the logo to the domain's DMARC record, providing another level of visual assurance to recipients that the email is legitimate. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is an email security standard designed to make sure that messages were not altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers. It uses digital signatures linked to the domain of the sender to verify the sender and ensure message integrity. SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method designed to prevent email spoofing. It specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain by creating a DNS record. This helps protect against spam by providing a way for receiving mail servers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThis information is helpful for researchers as it helps assess a domain's email security posture, uncover potential vulnerabilities, and verify the legitimacy of emails for phishing detection. These details can also provide insight into the hosting environment, potential service providers, and the configuration patterns of a target organization, assisting in investigative efforts.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Intro to DMARC, DKIM, and SPF (via Cloudflare)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/)\n- [EasyDMARC Domain Scanner](https://easydmarc.com/tools/domain-scanner)\n- [MX Toolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/)\n- [RFC-7208 - SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208)\n- [RFC-6376 - DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376)\n- [RFC-7489 - DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489)\n- [BIMI Group](https://bimigroup.org/)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>Firewall Detection\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/MfcxQt2/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-40-52.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nA WAF or web application firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others.\n\n###### Use Cases\nIt's useful to understand if a site is using a WAF, and which firewall software / service it is using, as this provides an insight into the sites protection against several attack vectors, but also may reveal vulnerabilities in the firewall itself.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [What is a WAF (via Cloudflare Learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/)\n- [OWASP - Web Application Firewalls](https://owasp.org/www-community/Web_Application_Firewall)\n- [Web Application Firewall Best Practices](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Best_Practices_Guide_WAF_v104.en.pdf)\n- [WAF - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Cb>HTTP Security Features\u003C/b>\u003C/summary>\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/LP05HMV/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-40-28.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nCorrectly configured security HTTP headers adds a layer of protection against common attacks to your site.

Either put them directly into an `.env` file in the projects root, or via the Netlify / Vercel UI, or by passing to the Docker container with the --env flag, or using your own environmental variable management system\n\nNote that keys that are prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are used client-side, and as such they must be scoped correctly with minimum privileges, since may be made visible when intercepting browser \u003C-> server network requests\n\n---\n\n### Developing\n\n1. Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/web-check.git`\n2. Cd into it, `cd web-check`\n3. Install dependencies: `yarn`\n4. Start the dev server, with `yarn dev`\n\nYou'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (V 18.16.1 or later) installed, plus [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) as well as [git](https://git-scm.com/).\nSome checks also require `chromium`, `traceroute` and `dns` to be installed within your environment. These jobs will just be skipped if those packages aren't present.\n\n\n---\n\n## Community\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions of any kind are very welcome, and would be much appreciated.\nFor Code of Conduct, see [Contributor Convent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).\n\nTo get started, fork the repo, make your changes, add, commit and push the code, then come back here to open a pull request. If you're new to GitHub or open source, [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3#let-s-make-our-first-pull-request-) or the [git docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) may help you get started, but feel free to reach out if you need any support.\n\n[![Submit a

something that doesn't work as it should, or would like to suggest a new feature, then go ahead and raise a ticket on GitHub.\nFor bugs, please outline the steps needed to reproduce, and include relevant info like system info and resulting logs.\n\n[![Raise an Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Raise_an_Issue-GitHub-%23060606?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=fff)](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check/issues/new/choose)\n\n### Supporting\n\nThe app will remain 100% free and open source.\nBut due to the amount of traffic that the hosted instance gets, the lambda function usage is costing about $25/month.\nAny help with covering the costs via GitHub Sponsorship would be much appreciated.\nIt's thanks to the support of the community that this project is able to be freely available for everyone :)\n\n[![Sponsor Lissy93 on
