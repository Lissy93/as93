I'd also come across the gizak/termui package, which seemed to be the perfect choice for plotting the charts.\n\nHowever, I found Go's memory safety to be less than ideal. The compiler was irritating and managing threads manually was difficult. I also came across an issue which, for the life of me, I could not resolve - when termui updated the screen, random characters from the previous view would remain, making the charts hard for the user to read.\n\nAfter spending nearly an entire weekend building out this project, I arrived at the tough realization that I had probably chosen the wrong tech stack. I was initially reluctant to scrap everything I had written so far, but it was the best way forward.\n\nInstead, I picked up Rust - a language I'd been curious about but hadn't found the right opportunity to dive into. Rust, much like Go, is fast and efficient, but with one key difference - it emphasizes safety and manages memory exceptionally well. Rust also compiles into a single binary and has a robust concurrency model. In short, it seemed to address many of the issues I had encountered with Go.\n\nRebuilding my app in Rust wasn't a walk in the park, though. It has a steep learning curve and some unique concepts, like ownership and borrowing, which took a while to wrap my head around. Nevertheless, the more I delved into it, the more I found myself appreciating its design. In particular, its ability to prevent common programming errors, like null pointer dereferencing and data races, was a huge win for me.\n\n**As developers, we need to remind ourselves that it's okay to take a step back, reassess our decisions, and change our course if necessary. After all, in the long run, it's not about how quickly we can finish a project but about how well we can adapt, learn, and grow along the way. That's how we build not just better software, but also become better developers.**\n\nThe new project is uploaded here:\n\n[![Lissy93/AdGuardian-Term - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/Lissy93/AdGuardian-Term.svg?fullname=)](https://github.com/Lissy93/AdGuardian-Term)\n\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Prerequisites\nIf you haven't already done so, you'll need to [install Go Lang](https://go.dev/doc/install).\u003Cbr>\nThen clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/OLD_AdGuardian-Term.git && cd OLD_AdGuardian-Term`\n\n### Developing\nRun `go run .` to start the app\n\n### Deploying\nRun `go build` to generate the executable for your system.\u003Cbr>\nYou can then launch that with `./adguardian-term`\n\n### Docker\nThere's also a Dockerfile, although the image is not published to any registry.\u003Cbr>\nThis can be built with: `docker build -t adguardian .`\u003Cbr>\nAnd then run, with: `docker run adguardian`\n\n### Configuring\nThe app requires details of your AdGuard Home instance (endpoint and credentials).\nI didn't get round to making these parameters into environmental variables.\nSo currently you'll need to set them in [`values.go`](https://github.com/Lissy93/OLD_AdGuardian-Term/blob/main/values/values.go)\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n> _**[Lissy93/OLD_AdGuardian](https://github.com/Lissy93/OLD_AdGuardian)** is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/Lissy93/OLD_AdGuardian/blob/master/LICENSE) © [Alicia Sykes](https://aliciasykes.com) 2022._\u003Cbr>\n> \u003Csup align=\"right\">For information, see \u003Ca href=\"https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license\">TLDR Legal > MIT\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Expand License\u003C/summary>\n\n```\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) Alicia Sykes \u003Calicia@omg.com> \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy \nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal \nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights \nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sub-license, and/or sell \ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished \nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included install \ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT ABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON INFRINGEMENT.
