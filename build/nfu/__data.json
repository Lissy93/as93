Uses **Flutter SDK V2.1.0 - V3.0.0**.\n\n#### Set Up Guide\n\n- Get the Code: `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/nfu.git` then `cd nfu`\n- Grab the dependencies `flutter pub get`\n- To keep the source code synced, you can `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch`\n- Then use Android Studio or your favourite editor along with the Flutter CLI to develop\n\nFor more info, check out the [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs), which are actually pretty awesome.\n\n#### Direcory Structure\n\n```\nnfu/\n├── android/\n├── build/\n├── ios/\n├── lib/\n│   ├── forms/\n│   ├── models/\n│   ├── screens/\n│   ├── utils/\n│   ├── widgets/\n│   └── main.dart\n└── pubspec.yaml\n```\n\n#### Also...\n\nShout out to [@faob-dev] for [folding_cell] and  [@Realank] for [flutter_datetime_picker], both components\nwere nice and neat, and thanks to them, it made building this little app a lot quicker.\n\nI'm quite new to Flutter, and always looking to improve, so if you see something \nthat could be better, it'd be awesome if you could let me know, or open an issue \nand I'll look into it- thanks!\n\n---\n\n\u003C!-- License + Copyright -->\n\u003Cp  align=\"center\">\n  \u003Ci>© \u003Ca href=\"https://aliciasykes.com\">Alicia Sykes\u003C/a> 2019\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ci>Licensed under \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/143d2ee01ccc5c052a17\">MIT\u003C/a>\u003C/i>\u003Cbr>\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/lissy93\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4KtpYxb/octocat-clean-mini.png\" />\u003C/a>\n\u003C/p>\n\n\u003C!-- Dinosaurs are Awesome -->\n\u003C!-- \n                        . - ~ ~ ~ - .\n      ..     _      .-~               ~-.\n     //|     \\ `..~                      `.\n    || |      }  }              /       \\  \\\n(\\   \\\\ \\~^..'                 |         }  \\\n \\`.-~  o      /       }       |        /    \\\n (__          |       /        |       /      `.\n  `- - ~ ~ -._|      /_ - ~ ~ ^|      /- _      `.\n              |     /          |     /     ~-.     ~- _\n              |_____|          |_____|         ~ - . _ _~_-_\n-->\n\n[//]: # (Links to legal and licensing)\n[license-as]: https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/143d2ee01ccc5c052a17\n[license-img]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1862727/68531648-69ef4200-030c-11ea-8d48-74af7a2d8304.png\n[legal-info]: https://aliciasykes.com/legal\n\n[//]: # (Links to better apps than this one)\n[habbit-tracker-android]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull\n[habitify-android]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unstatic.habitify\n[habitify-ios]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitify-habit-tracker/id1111447047\n[productive-android]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.to.do.list\n[productive-ios]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477\n[habit-ios]: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/habit-daily-tracker/id1445651730\n[done-ios]: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/done-a-simple-habit-tracker/id1103961876\n[loop-android]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits\n\n[//]: # (Links to people and libraries that I used)\n[@faob-dev]: https://github.com/faob-dev\n[folding_cell]: https://github.com/faob-dev/folding_cell\n[flutter_datetime_picker]: https://github.com/Realank/flutter_datetime_picker\n[@Realank]: https://github.com/Realank\n\n[//]: # (Links to my social platforms)\n[as-website]: https://aliciasykes.com\n[as-github]: https://github.com/lissy93\n[as-twitter]: https://twitter.com/Lissy_Sykes\n[as-instagram]: https://www.instagram.com/lissy_sykes93\n[as-linkedin]: https://linkedin.com/in/aliciasykes\n[as-keybase]: https://keybase.io/aliciasykes\n[as-blog]: https://blog.aliciasykes.com\n",{"name":3,"title":26},"NFU"],"uses":{"params":["repo"]}}]}
