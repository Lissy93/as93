The second (optional) parameter is a\nboolean, specifiying weather of not to remove duplicates.\n\n```javascript\nremoveWords(\"Hello world hello hello\", true); // [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nremoveWords(\"Hello world hello hello\", false); // [\"hello\", \"world\", \"hello\", \"hello\"]\n```\n\n## Using a custom word list\n```javascript\n\nvar names = ['jack', 'john', 'joe', 'james', 'jim']\nremoveWords(\"The winners are: Jack, John and Jim!!!\", true, names)\n// Will remove just all names\n```\n\n## Features\n- Case insensitive\n- Handles special characters, URL's and other non standard strings\n- By default doesn't return any duplicates, but can be specified in 2nd parameter\n- Doesn't return blanks or special characters\n- Thoroughly unit tested\n- Words list is customisable, optionally pass in your own array as the third parameter\n\n\n## Tests\nRun ```npm test```\n\n\n## Building\n- `gulp build` - Lints and compiles CoffeeScript\n- `gulp test` - Runs tests\n- `gulp` - Watches for changes, cleans working directory, builds and tests\n\n\n## Contributing\nIf you find an issue:\n - Feel free to raise it as an issue [here](https://github.com/Lissy93/remove-words/issues)\n (give as much detail about your scenario as possible) and I'll look into it\n - Or better yet submit a pull request with your feature or fix. Ensure all tests still pass\n and give a short sentence of why it should be merged in the PR description.\n\n## Development\n- Clone the repo and cd into it. `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/remove-words.git && cd $(basename $_ .git)`\n- Install dev dependencies `yarn install --production=false`\n- Build and/or watch `npm run build`/ `npm run watch`\n- Make changes, then run `npm test`\n\n## License\nMIT Â© [Alicia Sykes](http://aliciasykes.com) 2017.
