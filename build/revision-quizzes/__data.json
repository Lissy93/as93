Create, share and take quizzes, and compete against your class mates with the high scores league.\n\nRevisionQuizzes is a comprehensive online platform designed to help students with their revision.\nIt provides a fun and interactive way to learn, with a range of features designed to help users improve their knowledge.\nWhether you are a student, teacher, or just looking for a fun way to revise, revisionquizzes.com is the perfect solution!\n\n---\n\n## Deprication ⚠️\n\n> **Warning**\n> **This project is no longer maintained.**\u003Cbr>\n> It is recommend not to use the app, nor any of the code.\n\nI built this for fun, while I was at school. The aim was to make revision more interactive and social.\n\nWith heindsight and a decade later, I can safely say that the code is really quite awful. And since there's now much better quiz apps available, I am depricating and archiving this project.\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch4>Sceenshots\u003C/h4> 🖼️\u003C/summary>\n\nThere's a reason that I'm not a UI designer...\n\n![screenshots](https://i.ibb.co/5chGnsH/revision-quizzes-old-secreenshots.png)\n\nThe updated version wasn't much better:\n\n![screenshots - updated](https://i.ibb.co/fqZPRR4/revision-quizzes-secreenshots.png)\n\n\u003C/details>\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch4>Coursework 🍎\u003C/h4>\u003C/summary>\n\nLater, I extended the project a bit, and used it as part of my GCSE Computing Cousework.\n[Here's my write up](https://github.com/Lissy93/revision-quizzes/raw/master/F454%20Coursework%20-%20Revision%20Quizzes%20-%20Alicia%20Sykes%206063.pdf) that I submitted.\n\n\u003C/details>\n\n---\n\n## Deployment 🚀\nIt's a static PHP site.
