## Development

- Prerequisites: You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) an [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Get the code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/as93.git`
- Install dependencies: `cd as93 && npm i`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`

---

## Deployment
Follow the [Development](#development) instructions above.<br> 
When you're ready to deploy, run `yarn build` and upload the `dist/` to any CDN, static hosting provider or web server.<br>
Or simply import your fork of the project into Netlify or Vercel - so easy!

---

## Configuring
All user-related settings goes in the `config.ts` file.
Other than that, the only other thing you need is a GitHub API key in `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var (to avoid being limited while fetching repos)
